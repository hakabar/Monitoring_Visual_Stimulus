# Monitoring_Visual_Stimulus
Python Script to Display a visual stimulus moving in function of a noise signal (multiprocess)

The idea of this script is to work with multiprocess in Python 2.7 to create a Gaussian noise signal and use it to move a visual stimulus in the screen (with a child process) while we keep tracking of the value of the Gaussian signal that is used at each instant. To do this the matplotlib animation “ffunction” is used
